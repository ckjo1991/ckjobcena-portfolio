# CK Portfolio MVP

Token-driven portfolio app built with React, Vite, Tailwind, and React Router.

## Current Status

- Foundation setup complete: Vite baseline, Tailwind config, token mapping, and routing.
- MVP single-page sections implemented on `/`:
  hero, projects preview, about preview, and contact.
- Project detail pages now render a full structured case-study layout after a project preview card click.
- Project detail pages now include a right-side sticky scrollspy with active-section highlight and vertical progress (appears after Project Summary).
- Floating section navigation is implemented with active-section tracking.
- Navigation active state now auto-recovers if smooth-scroll is interrupted before reaching the target section.
- Reveal stagger delays now use duration-only motion tokens for valid token-driven timing.
- Light/dark mode toggle is live with persisted preference.
- Theme persistence now fails safely when browser storage is unavailable.
- Case-study mobile controls now respond correctly when resizing between desktop/mobile breakpoints.
- Mobile nav label visibility and overflow behavior are stabilized.
- Brand mark is integrated from `public/ck.svg` as an icon-only shell element.
- CSS spacing/layout values are normalized to the 8pt scale for component spacing.
- Section reveal and shell entrance motion timing now uses transition tokens (`--transition-fast/base/slow`).
- Typography now uses responsive tokens for mobile/tablet/desktop (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `body-lg`, `body`, `small`).
- Hero heading now uses semantic `text-h1` with token-driven scaling across breakpoints.
- Responsive typography values were tuned for smoother size jumps and better mobile readability.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- ESLint

## Source Layout

- `src/app/AppRoutes.jsx`: route composition and page wiring
- `src/features/`: feature-specific modules (home, project detail, etc.)
- `src/shared/data/`: shared static portfolio data
- `src/shared/hooks/`: reusable hooks
- `src/shared/ui/`: shared icons and UI primitives
- `src/styles/index.css`: global tokens and component styles

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build and lint:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Generate sitemap/robots files manually:

```bash
SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com npm run sitemap
```

## Routes

- `/` (single-page anchored sections)
- `/projects/:projectId` (structured case-study detail page)

## SEO Files

- `public/sitemap.xml` and `public/robots.txt` are generated by `scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs`.
- `npm run build` runs sitemap generation automatically via `prebuild`.
- Set `SITE_URL` (or `VITE_SITE_URL`) to your production domain before build/deploy so sitemap URLs are correct.

## Section Anchors On `/`

- `#hero`
- `#projects-preview`
- `#about-preview`
- `#contact-me`

## Branding Asset

- Logo file: `public/ck.svg`
- App usage: `src="/ck.svg"`
- Logo background token: `--color-accent-500` (`#F5C542`)
- App shell treatment: icon-only mark with no text wrapper
- Render size: `48px x 48px` (`.brand-mark`)

## Theme Toggle

- Toggle location: bottom-right (`.theme-toggle`)
- Modes: dark and light
- Persistence key: `ck-portfolio-theme` in `localStorage`
- Light theme uses token overrides under `[data-theme="light"]`

## Notes

- Product requirements and guardrails: `prd.md`
- Build plan and implementation decisions: `planning.md`
- Milestone tracking and execution status: `tasks.md`
